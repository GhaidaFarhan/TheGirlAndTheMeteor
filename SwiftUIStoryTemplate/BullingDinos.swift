Jack said ohh no, that's not cool. What are they saying? 'They're saying silly things, like it's strange for a girl to be friends with a dinosaur.' Lisa said . he replayed: that's not true!I think it's awesome. We make a fantastic team! then Lisa said : I know, right? But their words are starting to bother me. I even got a bit mad about it.
